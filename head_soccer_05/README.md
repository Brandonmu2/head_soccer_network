# HeadSoccer

Welcome, this is my first project in github. In order tu run the source code you will need pygame, pybox2d, and our modified version of podsixnet to support the udp network protocoll. To test the binary releases you can download them from mega, https://mega.co.nz/#F!dlx0ALAb!9iKeHnW2DTKtiXYqrg5V2A for windows and https://mega.co.nz/#F!AhZGCIDB!Tz2qsh0qRftU-MV_5lG8qA for linux. All versions include server and client versions. The client run file is *main.py* while the server one is *server_run.py*. You can update some constants and configuration in data/config.py. The project is not very commented because it is very new but in the future we will add comments to each file
